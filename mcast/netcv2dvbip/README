This is a tool for streaming DVB TS packets via udp multicasts on demand from the netceiver.
It listens for IGMP(v1/v2/v3) join/leave multicast group messages on the network and starts/stops 
the corresponding streams accordingly. It uses a channels.conf file for channel information.
Each channel is mapped to one multicast group starting with 239.255.0.1 and so on.

The software is based on source code from the following projects:

IGMP component of vdr-streamdev-plugin 
Frank Schmirler <vdrdev@schmirler.de>

VDR
Klaus Schmidinger <kls@cadsoft.de>

Netceiver mcli-lib
Baycom GmbH <info@baycom.de>

Quick Compile Howto:

1)
svn co https://svn.baycom.de/repos/vdr-mcli-plugin/mcast/

2)
cd mcast

3)
cd client
make 
cd ..

4) 
cd netcv2dvbip
make

5)
./netcv2dvbip

Notes:

	* Each UDP packet contains 7*188=1316 bytes ( 7 TS packets)
	* channels.conf: only frontend paramters are needed. PIDs are
	  extracted from the PAT/PMT on demand.
	* Windows: MS Loopback Adapter Driver has to be installed if you only
	  want to stream local multicasts.
	  Configure a static unused IP for this adapter and add a route for
	  239.255.0.0/16 to this ip
	  eg.: route add 239.255.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 10.11.12.13
	  where 10.11.12.13 is the static IP address of the loopback
	  adapter.
	  Linux: specify the option "-b lo" and make sure that the
	  multicast flag is set on the lo device. 
	  If not, type: ifconfig lo multicast

Known Issues:

	* Linux: netcv2dvbip make use of the multicast routing API to be
	  able to receive all IGMP (v1,v2) messages on the subnet without joining 
	  all groups. If you have configured 200 channels, then at least
	  those 200 groups would have to be joined to receive the group
	  specific queries. IGMPv3 does not suffer this "problem", since
	  all reports are sent to the group 224.0.0.22.
	  So, if you are already using software that make use of this API,
	  netcv2dvbip will fail to start, because only one program can make
	  use of this API.
